# The *new* Cognate compiler!
## Highly experimental!
## Very unstable!

To build, simply run `make`. You'll need gcc and probably some other stuff I can't remember. To compile a program, use `./cognac foo.cog`, which *should* produce a `foo.c` c program and a `foo` executable.

*Please* submit an issue if you find any bugs - I know they're there!!
